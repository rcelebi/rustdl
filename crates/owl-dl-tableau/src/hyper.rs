//! Hyperresolution engine — hypertableau Phases H1 (Horn) + H2
//! (disjunctive-head branching).
//!
//! See [`docs/hypertableau-scoping.md`](../../docs/hypertableau-scoping.md).
//! This is the first phase that *reasons*: it runs Horn
//! hyperresolution (DL-clauses with ≤1 head atom — no branching)
//! over a minimal class-labelled completion graph, with anywhere
//! blocking to terminate cyclic `∃`. H2 adds backtracking search
//! over disjunctive-head clauses ([`HyperEngine::decide`]): Horn
//! propagation runs to fixpoint, then an open disjunction is split
//! and each disjunct tried in turn with save/restore of the graph.
//!
//! It is **not** wired into the reasoner facade or the default
//! tableau — it's a standalone engine, validated in isolation
//! against hand-built Horn ontologies and (in a later step) the EL
//! saturation closure. The existing path is untouched.
//!
//! ## Why Horn is deterministic
//!
//! A clause `U1 ∧ … ∧ Um → V` fires only when its *whole* body
//! matches at a node (binding the central variable `x` and, if the
//! body has a role atom `R(x,y)`, a successor `y`). A single head
//! atom is then asserted with no choice — that's the
//! demand-driven, branch-free propagation that makes the ~96 %
//! Horn fragment of the corpus cheap (see
//! `docs/hypertableau-scoping.md` §H0).
